# Rock, paper, scissors
This is my first JS project â€” a simple "Rock, paper, scissors" game for DevTools console
Let's get you through it block by block, bloke

First, I wrote the function that will be responsible for the computer's choice in every round
Each time machine randomly chooses rock, paper or scissors in its' eternal struggle against humanity

Next I've defined variables responsible for both choices in every round
There is also some error handling added for the player input
Both choices made case-insensitive and lead to uniformity by .toLowerCase() method

Then I wrote a function that will cover the entire round of the game

And finally, we find the winner and print the result of completed round into DevTools console
