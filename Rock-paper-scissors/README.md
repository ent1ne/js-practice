# Rock, paper, scissors
This is my first JS project â€” a simple "Rock, paper, scissors" game for DevTools console

Each time the game randomly decides computer's choice and asks you to choose and print "rock", "paper" or "scissors" 

Then it compares choices made by you and computer and finds the winner, or declares a tie
